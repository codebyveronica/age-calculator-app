## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

With this project I had the opportunity to improve my JavaScript skills with form validation. Validating the date can be a little misleading if you don't do it right. I learned the right way after making a few mistakes. Validate if it is a valid day as well. But overall, I found this project relatively easy.

### Continued development

I will continue improving my skills with JavaScript, and also HTML and CSS by creating more projects. I think I'll soon start learning some JavaScript libraries to deepen my knowledge.
